# Website-Performance-Analysis-using-Python
A Python-based project that analyzes and monitors the performance of websites.Evaluating various metrics related to a website’s functionality, user engagement, and overall success in achieving business goals.

### Technologies Used :
  1. Programming Language: Python
  2. Libraries:
     - pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
     - matplotlib : Visualization.
  3. Time Series Analysis
### Steps:
  1. To get started with the task of Website Performance Analysis in Python, the first step is to import the necessary libraries like Pandas, load the dataset, and convert it into various formats for analysis.
  2. To handle the issue of the first row containing errors or unwanted data, you can preprocess the dataset by skipping the first row and ensuring that the data starts from the second row. Additionally, you can convert the 
   dataset into the appropriate format for analysis.
  3. To convert the column info and summary statistics of a dataset into different formats, you can use methods provided by pandas such as info(), describe().
  4. To convert the date column into an appropriate datetime format and group it for further analysis, you can follow these steps in Python using pandas. Here’s how you can transform the date column into different formats and then group the data for time series analysis.
  5. Visualizing User and Session Trends Over Time:

he graph reveals noticeable fluctuations in both the number of users and sessions, suggesting the presence of daily cycles or periods of heightened traffic. The trends for both metrics are similar, which aligns with the expectation that an increase in users typically leads to more sessions. Certain peaks may be associated with marketing campaigns, promotions, or special events.
  6. User Engagement Analysis:
 After analyzing session trends, we will now focus on User Engagement. This phase will involve evaluating key metrics, including:
    - Average Engagement Time per Session:
     
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19de1d1f-7eca-4b7f-84ad-94cec1bde6a0)
   The time spent per session exhibits variations throughout the observed period, with distinct peaks indicating moments of heightened user engagement. These peaks could be linked to the release of specific content or particular events.
   - Events per Session:

   Events per Session: The number of events per session stays fairly consistent with some fluctuations. Notable peaks might suggest periods of increased interactivity, potentially due to engaging content or additional features being utilized by users.
   -  Engaged Sessions per User:

   This ratio shows minor fluctuations but typically reflects that a significant portion of sessions per user are engaged. High points in this metric likely indicate periods when content is particularly relevant or captivating for users.
   - Engagement Rate:

   Engagement Rate Analysis: The engagement rate over time reflects the proportion of sessions deemed engaged relative to the total sessions. Fluctuations in this rate could indicate variations in user content preference or the effectiveness of specific user acquisition strategies.
6. Analyze correlations between them:
   - Avg Engagement Time vs Events/Session:
